              Conzooming was born from my personal frustration with finding
              healthy, satisfying lunch options in a busy office environment.
              Faced with overpriced, unhealthy meals, I realized many of my
              colleagues shared the same struggle. This sparked the idea for a
              lunch subscription service delivering fresh, delicious meals to
              busy professionals.
            </p>
            <p className="mb-2">
              What started as a simple Google Forms initiative in August 2022,
              where colleagues shared their meal preferences, quickly grew into
              a success. Our cloud kitchen served high-quality meals using the
              freshest ingredients. The overwhelming demand showed that the need
              was bigger than just our office.
            </p>
            <p className="mb-2">
              As we evolved from 'Lunch Time' to Conzooming, we shifted to a
              scalable model, partnering with trusted vendors to meet diverse
              dietary needs.
            </p>
            <p>
              Conzooming is now about more than just mealsâ€”it's about ensuring
              everyone can enjoy a healthy, satisfying lunch, no matter how
              hectic life gets. Because life may be busy, but your meals
              shouldn't be.
